# MATH 307 Project
A repo for storing questions, instructions and coding implementation of such questions

Naming and file-type conventions:
- Written solutions to a problem should be in .pdf
- A code file should be in .py file.
- [numberProblem]_written.pdf, or [numberProblem]_coding.py, for example, 1.1_written.pdf, or 1.1_coding.py
- Below is a checklist for all of the problems, if they are done in coding (if possible/required), in written and the individual that it is assigned towards.
