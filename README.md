# MATH 307 Project
A repo for storing questions, instructions and coding implementation of such questions

Naming and file-type conventions:
- Written solutions to a problem should be in .pdf
- A code file should be in .py file.
- [numberProblem]_written.pdf, or [numberProblem]_coding.py, for example, 1.1_written.pdf, or 1.1_coding.py
- Below is a checklist for all of the problems, if they are done in coding (if possible/required), in writing and the individual it is assigned towards.

When you are committing changes towards the main:
- Do check if you have already pulled the latest - if not, then pull from the latest, and add your new problem / updated problem to the folder
- Your commit should be - Added [numberProblem] Written / Coding, or Update [numberProblem] Written / Coding (so that I can have an easier time trying to trace back the commits), and you should be only committing one problem at a time
- There's also a miscellaneous folder, for other files that are used within the project
